# PulseMart Sales Dashboard  
 
## 📌 Project Objective  
To design and develop an **PulseMart Sales Dashboard** in **Power BI** that delivers real-time insights into **sales amount, profit trends, product categories, sub-categories, and payment methods**.  

The dashboard helps stakeholders monitor **KPIs**, track sales and profit trends, analyze category & state-level performance, and make **data-driven business decisions** to improve product strategy, marketing, and operations.

## 🚨 Business Problem  
Retail businesses generate large amounts of transactional data. Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to:  
- Monitor **Total Sales (438K)**, **Profit (37K)**, and **Quantity Sold (5615)**  
- Track **monthly profit performance** across the year  
- Understand **category-wise and sub-category-wise contributions**  
- Analyze **state-level demand distribution**  
- Identify **customer payment preferences**  
- Detect trends for **inventory and order management**  

---

## ❓ Key Questions (KPIs)  
- What is the **total sales, profit, and quantity** achieved?  
- Which **states** contribute the most to quantity sold?  
- How does **profit vary across months**?  
- Which **product categories and sub-categories** drive revenue and profit?  
- What is the **customer preference by payment method**?  
- What are the **overall sales trends** across months and quarters?

## ⚙️ Process  
- **Data Import & Cleaning:** Imported transactional retail data into Power BI, removed inconsistencies using **Power Query**.  
- **Data Transformation:** Created calculated columns and **DAX measures** for KPIs (Sales, Profit, Quantity, % Contribution).  
- **Data Modeling:** Established relationships between fact (orders) and dimension (state, product, payment) tables.  
- **Visualization Setup:**  
  - KPI Cards – Sales, Profit, Quantity  
  - Line/Bar Charts – Profit by Month, Order Trend over Time  
  - TreeMap – Sales Analysis by Category & Sub-Category  
  - Donut Charts – Quantity by Category, Payment Mode  
  - Bar Charts – State-wise and Sub-Category Profit Analysis  
- **Dashboard Design:** Added global filters for **Quarter & Payment Mode**, designed in a professional **dark-themed layout** for clarity.
